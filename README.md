# Calcium_Imaging_Denoising
Submission for the AI4Life Calcium Imaging Denoising Challenge 2025. Implements self-supervised Noise2Void denoising using NAFNet architecture, optimized for calcium imaging data with photon shot and read noise. Supports 3D stacks, preserves spatial-temporal dynamics. Docker-ready for Grand Challenge.
